\subsection{Approximating the excess return equation}\label{excess_return_approx}

We want to approximate the excess return equation
\[
\E_{t}\bs{(\Rfree_{t+1} - \Rfix)(\Gc_{t+1}c_{t+1})^{-\rho}} = 0
\]
Note that $\Gc_{t+1}c_{t+1} = C_{t+1}$. We can then divide both sides of the equation by $C_{t+1}$ and get
\[
\E_{t}\bs{(\Rfree_{t+1} - \Rfix)\bp{\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_{t}}}^{-\rho}} = 0
\]
The first approximation we can apply is that
\[
\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_{t}} \approx 1 + \D\ln C_{t+1}
\]
for small enough values of $\D\ln C_{t+1}$. Then observe that $(1+x)^{\a} \approx 1 + \a x$ for small $x$. Put together,
\[
\E_{t}\bs{(\Rfree_{t+1} - \Rfix)\bp{1-\rho\D\ln C_{t+1}}} \approx 0
\]
We can then expand this to
\begin{align*}
    \E_{t}\bs{(\Rfree_{t+1} - \Rfix)\bp{1-\rho\D\ln C_{t+1}}} &= \E_{t}\bs{(\Rfree_{t+1} - \Rfix)}\E_{t}\bs{1-\rho\D\ln C_{t+1}} - \cov{\rho\D\ln C_{t+1},\,\Rfree_{t+1}}\\
    \E_{t}\bs{\Rfree_{t+1}} - \Rfix &\approx \frac{\rho\cov{\D\ln C_{t+1},\,\Rfree_{t+1}}}{1 - \rho\E_{t}\bs{\D\ln C_{t+1}}}
\end{align*}
Around steady state values of normalized consumption, $\E_{t}\D\ln C_{t+1} \approx \E_{t}\D\ln P_{t+1} = \g-\frac{\s_{\psi}^2}{2} \approx 0$, where $\g = \ln \G$. This holds true more generally as well. Then
\[
\E_{t}\bs{\Rfree_{t+1}} - \Rfix \approx \rho\cov{\D\ln C_{t+1},\,\Rfree_{t+1}}
\]
