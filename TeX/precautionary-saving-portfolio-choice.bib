We show that the key variables found to be positive predictors of actual stock returns in the asset-pricing literature are also highly correlated with investor's subjective expected returns, but with the opposite sign. Moreover, our analysis of the microdata indicates that subjective expectations of both risk and returns on stocks are strongly influenced by perceptions of economic conditions. In particular, when investors believe macroeconomic conditions are more expansionary, they tend to expect both higher returns and lower volatility. This is difficult to reconcile with the canonical view that expected returns on stocks rise during recessions to compensate household investors for increased exposure or sensitivity to macroeconomic risks. Finally, the relevance of these investors' subjective expectations is supported by the finding of a significant link between their expectations and portfolio choices. In particular, we show that portfolio equity positions tend to be higher for those respondents that anticipate higher expected returns or lower uncertainty.{\textexclamdown}/p{\textquestiondown}}

Economically plausible calibrations suggest young investors should take substantial short positions in the stock market. Because of cointegration the young agent's human capital effectively becomes ``stock-like.'' However, for older agents with shorter times-to-retirement, cointegration does not have sufficient time to act, and thus their human capital becomes more ``bond-like.'' Together, these effects create hump-shaped life-cycle portfolio holdings, consistent with empirical observation. These results hold even when asset return predictability is accounted for.{\textexclamdown}/p{\textquestiondown}}

We document a number of novel results. First, individuals earn markedly different average returns on their net worth (a standard deviation of 22.1\%) and on its components. Second, heterogeneity in returns does not arise merely from differences in the allocation of wealth between safe and risky assets: returns are heterogeneous even within narrow asset classes. Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth: moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the net worth distribution increases the return by 18 percentage points (and 10 percentage points if looking at net-of-tax returns). Fourth, individual wealth returns exhibit substantial persistence over time. We argue that while this persistence partly arises from stable differences in risk exposure and assets scale, it also reflects heterogeneity in sophistication and financial information, as well as entrepreneurial talent. Finally, wealth returns are correlated across generations. We discuss the implications of these findings for several strands of the wealth inequality debate.},

Households with low risk aversion smooth earnings shocks with a small buffer stock of assets, and consequently most of them (optimally) never invest in equities.

The unconstrained and constrained behavior when borrowing limits are based on labor income or on asset holdings of the household are compared, and the effects of varying the tightness of such limits are examined. Credit market conditions, as reflected in the tightness of borrowing constraints, can have serious effects on portfolio composition. Constraints can reduce or eliminate effects of earnings risk on wealth holdings. They can also reverse effects of risk aversion and of earnings risk on stockholding relative to those predicted by models that abstract from such constraints. As a result, samples contaminated with borrowing-constrained households will tend to underplay or even reverse the impact of risk aversion and of earnings risk expected on the basis of unconstrained models. The analysis suggests caution in basing sample splits on observed asset holdings, and in interpreting the failure of empirical studies to uncover sizeable precautionary effects on wealth and on portfolios.},

We consider the sensitivity of savings and portfolio allocation rules to different assumptions about utility, the stochastic process for income and asset returns, and market frictions (transactions costs and short-sale constraints). Under CRRA time additive utility, habit persistence utility, and for a broad range of parameterizations, the model predicts that investors wish to borrow and invest all of their savings in stocks. This qualitative implication is robust to the introduction of significant transaction costs in the stock market, and contrasts sharply with portfolio allocation models in which there is no labor income.{\textexclamdown}/p{\textquestiondown}}

Among other approaches to investigate this puzzle, recent research has started to elicit private households' expectations of stock market returns. This paper reports findings from a study that collected data over a 2-year period both on households' stock market expectations (subjective probabilities of gains or losses) and on whether they own stocks. We document substantial heterogeneity in financial market expectations. Expectations are correlated with stock ownership. Over the 2 years of our data stock market prices increased and expectations of future stock market price changes also increased, lending support to the view that expectations are influenced by recent stock gains or losses.

  abstract = {{\textexclamdown}p{\textquestiondown}We characterize generalized disappointment aversion (GDA) risk preferences that can overweight lower-tail outcomes relative to expected utility. We show in an endowment economy that recursive utility with GDA risk preferences generates effective risk aversion that is countercyclical. This feature comes from endogenous variation in the probability of disappointment in the representative agent's intertemporal consumption-saving problem that underlies the asset pricing model. The variation in effective risk aversion produces a large equity premium and a risk-free rate that is procyclical and has low volatility in an economy with a simple autoregressive endowment-growth process.{\textexclamdown}/p{\textquestiondown}}

  abstract = {{\textexclamdown}p{\textquestiondown}I document that dividend growth and returns on the aggregate U.S. stock market are more correlated with consumption growth in bad economic times. In a consumption-based asset pricing model with a generalized disappointment-averse investor and small, IID consumption shocks, this feature results in a realistic equity premium despite low risk aversion. The model is consistent with the main facts about stock market risk premiums inferred from equity index options, remains tightly parameterized, and allows for analytical solutions for asset prices. An extension with non-IID dynamics accounts for excess volatility and return predictability, while preserving the model's consistency with option moments.{\textexclamdown}/p{\textquestiondown}}

With idiosyncratic labor income risk, the optimal allocation to stocks is unambiguously larger for employed investors than for retired investors, consistent with the typical recommendations of investment advisors. Increasing idiosyncratic labor income risk raises investors' willingness to save and reduces their stock portfolio allocation towards the level of retired investors. Positive correlation between labor income and stock returns has a further negative effect and can actually reduce stockholdings below the level of retired investors.{\textexclamdown}/p{\textquestiondown}}
