\subsection{Approximation of expectations}

I recurrently use the following approximation of the expectation of a function of a random variable $X$ around its expectation, $\mu_X$.
\begin{align*}
    f(X) &\approx f(\mu_X) + f'(\mu_X)(X - \mu_X) + \frac{1}{2}f''(\mu_X)(X - \mu_X)^2\\
    \E\bs{f(X)} &\approx f(\mu_X) + \frac{1}{2}f''(\mu_X)\var{X}
\end{align*}
Accordingly, we can compute the expectation of a function of a random vector $X = \bp{X_1,\,...,\,X_k}$ around its expectation vector $\mu_X = \bp{\mu_{X,\,1},\,...,\,\mu_{X,\,k}}$
\begin{align*}
    f(X) &\approx f(\mu_X) + (\nabla f)(\mu_X)\cdot(X - \mu_X) + \frac{1}{2}\tr{H(f)(\mu_X)(X - \mu_X)(X - \mu_X)'}\\
    \E\bs{f(X)} & \approx f(\mu_X) + \frac{1}{2}\tr{H(f)(\mu_X)\S_X}\\
    &= f(\mu_X) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{k}\pcd{f(X)}{X_i}{X_j}{\mu_X}\cov{X_i,\,X_j}
\end{align*}
where $\S_X$ is the covariance matrix of $X$, $(\nabla f)(\mu_X)$ is the gradient of $f$, and $H(f)(\mu_X)$ is the Hessian matrix of $f$, both evaluated at $\mu_X$.
